## MassBit

[MassBit](https://blog.massbit.io/7-things-about-massbit-you-might-not-know/) provides fully decentralized solutions for Defi and Web3 App project development. Currently, three products are in the stage of development: MassBit Route, Cross-chain Indexing, and MassBit Insight. The powerful ‘glue’ holding together and supporting all the products is the MassBit Verification Protocol, which is based on Proof of Stake. The protocol incentivizes those working within the system to verify each other’s work. Verifying other nodes, gateways, or indexers gives rewards or penalties for the mistakes to each individual or entity. From that, the protocol ensures the whole network’s health.

One of three products - The MassBit Route - a decentralized blockchain distribution network (BDN) empowered by MassBit Verification Protocol is currently on Testnet. MassBit Route offers a quick, stable, and reliable service, all at a fraction of the cost of centralized networks. Running MBR is also open to web3 apps and developers all over the globe check out our [Testnet](https://blog.massbit.io/massbitroute-whitelist-is-open/).
